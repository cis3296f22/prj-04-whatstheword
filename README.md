# What's the Word - A Web-Based Word Game
This document proposes a web-based application that expands upon the idea of the popular New York Times game Wordle. In Wordle players try to guess a five letter word in six attempts. Re-imagining this concept, WhatsTheWord will allow players to change the length of the mystery word, and they will be challenged to guess it in the length of the word plus one attempts. This concept allows WhatsTheWord to accommodate users of a variety of skill levels.
Adding an screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.
